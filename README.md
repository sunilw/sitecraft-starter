SiteCraft Starter is a WordPress theme adapted heavily from Sage.

Sage saves you hours creating your templates and workflow.

Where a major strength of Sage is in the build tooling, it still leaves you with a naked theme.
SiteCraft Starter saves you a few hours kickstarting your project by starting you off with the more style.

We drop the bootstrap menu back in, and give you the Yeti bootswatch.

Builds are tested for compatibility with Divi, Toolset, Beaver Builder and Advanced Custom Fields, because these are tools that I find suitable for many different kinds of projects.
